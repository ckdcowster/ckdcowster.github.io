        <ul>
            <li><b>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</b><br>
                Avoid code duplication.<br>
                Reuse code through functions, classes, or modules to improve maintainability.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</b><br>
                Design systems as simply as possible.<br>
                Avoid unnecessary complexity.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Easy to understand</b><br>
                Clear names for everything.<br>
                Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain why instead of what.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Separation of Concerns</b><br>
                Divide a program into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern or functionality.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>High Cohesion and Low Coupling</b><br>
                High Cohesion: Related functions are kept together.<br>
                Low Coupling: Components are independent and changes in one don't heavily affect others.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Package-Oriented Design</b><br>
                Organize code into "small", cohesive packages.<br>
                Each package should have a clear purpose and minimal public API.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Encapsulation</b><br>
                Hide internal state and require all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Composition Over Inheritance</b><br>
                Favour composing objects with desired behaviour over inheriting from a base class.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Dependency Injection</b><br>
                An object's dependencies are provided from the outside rather than the object creating them itself.<br>
                This makes the code more flexible, testable, and easier to maintain.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Minimalism in Public APIs</b><br>
                Define small, focused interfaces.<br>
                Keep exported functions, types, and variables to a minimum.<br>
                Use lowercase names for Unexported identifiers.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Avoid Global State</b><br>
                Prefer passing dependencies explicitly rather than relying on global variables.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Idiomatic Error Handling</b><br>
                Handle error first.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Narrow scope</b><br>
                Compilers can more easily optimize memory and register usage when variable lifetimes are short and well-defined.<br>
                Developers don't have to keep track of a variable across a large block of code.<br>
                Reduces the risk of variable shadowing and makes it easier to detect.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Efficient code</b><br>
                Avoid making multiple (temporary) copies of variables.<br>
                Prefer to pass by reference/pointer for large data.<br>
                <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
